This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for reference only.

- `orientation.ipynb` validates that applying the 2dseq orientation convention
  yields consistent scanner-space axes: x/y map to operator LR and bottom-to-top,
  while z maps to front-to-back across slice/readout sweeps.
- The notebook captures the acquisition setup and expected scanner-space behavior
  so users can reproduce the checks and confirm orientation normalization.
